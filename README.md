# Leetcode-

An overview of my LeetCode Solutions. Decided to finally start doing Leetcode to put my CS1010S (Programming Methodology), CS2040 (Discrete Structures and Algorithms), CS3244 (ML) and CS3243 (Intro to AI) to the test.
Disclaimer! my coding and methodology may have some errors or areas of improvement. If you identified any mistakes/ways for me to improve, please share with me senpais! Still a code mugger as always. :")
