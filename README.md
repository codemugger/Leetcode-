# Leetcode-

An overview of my LeetCode Solutions. Decided to finally start doing Leetcode to put my CS1010S (Programming Methodology), CS2040 (Discrete Structures and Algorithms), CS3244 (ML) and CS3243 (Intro to AI) to the test.

Disclaimer! my coding and methodology may have some errors or areas of improvement. If you identified any mistakes/ways for me to improve, please share with me senpais! Still a code mugger as always. :") 

Also, some codes (more efficient ones) were appended from the LeetCode Discussion Forum and solutions tab. However, they are NOT submitted on any of the educational platforms and the purpose of this repository is purely for personal reference and reference for potential employers. Due credit will be given to the respective LeetCode users!
